A molecule viewer for AltspaceVR

Initial focus on immune system proteins. 

This video shows the molecular details of how a cell chops up peptide chains, grabs the parts, and places them on its own cell surface. Then killer T-cells check the pieces and if they are recognized as not part of "self", it kills the cell.
